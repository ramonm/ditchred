# Privacy Policy for Ditch Red

*Last Updated: November 14, 2024*

## Introduction
This privacy policy explains how the Ditch Red extension ("Extension") handles information. We are committed to transparency and protecting your privacy.

## Information Collection and Use

### Domain Name Checking
- The Extension reads the domain name of your currently active tab (e.g., "example.com")
- This information is used solely to check against our public list of domains
- Domain checks happen locally within your browser
- No domain information is stored, logged, or transmitted to any servers

### List Updates
- The Extension fetches a public JSON file from GitHub containing domain names
- This file is cached locally for one hour to minimize GitHub API requests
- The GitHub repository is public and transparent at: https://github.com/ramonm/ditchred

## Data Collection and Storage
The Extension:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track browsing history
- Does NOT store visited domains
- Does NOT use cookies
- Does NOT use analytics
- Does NOT transmit any user data

## Local Storage
The Extension only stores:
- A cached copy of the public domain list
- The timestamp of the last list update

This data is stored locally in your browser and is automatically cleared when you uninstall the Extension.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension only connects to:
- raw.githubusercontent.com - to fetch the public domain list

No other external services are used.

## Data Security
- All domain checking happens locally within your browser
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- The domain list is fetched using HTTPS for security

## Changes to Domain List
- The domain list is maintained publicly on GitHub
- Changes to the list are transparent and viewable in the repository
